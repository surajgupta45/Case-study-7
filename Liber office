1)Understanding the Developmental Models: LibreOffice is an open-source office suite developed by The Document Foundation. It follows a community-driven and collaborative developmental model. This means that developers from around the world contribute to its development voluntarily. The development process is open to anyone who wants to participate, making it a truly open and inclusive project. This model allows for rapid innovation, frequent updates, and a diverse range of contributors.
2)Licensing: LibreOffice is licensed under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0) and the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 (LGPLv3). These licenses are open-source licenses that grant users the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software. It ensures that LibreOffice remains free and open for anyone to use, study, and contribute to.
3)Mode of Funding: LibreOffice primarily relies on donations and sponsorships for its funding. The Document Foundation, which oversees LibreOffice's development, encourages users and organizations to contribute financially to support the project. Donations and sponsorships help cover the costs of infrastructure, marketing, and development, ensuring the project's sustainability. This funding model allows LibreOffice to remain independent and free from commercial interests.
4)Commercial/Non-Commercial Use: LibreOffice is versatile and can be used for both commercial and -non-commercial purposes. Many businesses, government agencies, and educational institutions use LibreOffice as a cost-effective alternative to proprietary office suites like Microsoft Office. Since it is open-source and free, it is especially attractive to organizations looking to reduce software licensing costs. However, individual users and non-profit organizations also benefit from LibreOffice's feature-rich office suite without any cost constraints
